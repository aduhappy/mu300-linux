# Findings: running Linux on the ZTE F50 / MU300 (Unisoc T760)

Everything below was verified on a ZTE F50 (hardware MU300, firmware `MU300_ZYV1.0.0B09`,
Android 13, stock kernel `5.4.254-android12-9-g9c6342244991`) during September 2026.
Each item lists the symptom, the root cause and the fix, so it can be reused for other
UMS9620 devices (for example the ZTE U30 Air).

## Boot chain and safe testing

### 1. Slot b one-shot trial (never touch boot_a)
* Linux is written to **boot_b** only, and the 32-byte AOSP `bootloader_control` block at
  offset `0x800` of `misc` is set so that slot b has the highest priority.
* **Unisoc LK treats `tries_remaining == 1 && successful_boot == 0` as an already failed boot**
  (`ANDROID: slot 1 booted fail, rolling back spl and reboot into normal`). A one-shot trial therefore
  needs `tries_remaining = 2`: LK decrements it to 1 and boots slot b; if that boot fails, the next boot
  rolls back to slot a.
* Linux `init` writes the original slot-a block back to `misc` as one of its first steps, so any later
  reboot returns to Android.
* The `uboot_log` partition contains LK's ring log. It is the best source for "which slot was chosen" and
  "why did it reset" (`rst_mode`, `charge first poweron reset`, watchdog flags).

### 2. Boot ramdisk must be LZ4 legacy
* Symptom: `RAMDISK: lz4 image found at block 0`, `RAMDISK: incomplete write (-28 != 8388608)`, then
  `VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(1,0)`.
* Cause: vendor_boot's ramdisk is LZ4 legacy; a gzip boot ramdisk appended to it is not unpacked as an
  initramfs by this 5.4 kernel, which then falls back to the legacy `/dev/ram0` image path.
* Fix: compress the boot ramdisk with `lz4 -l`. Also add a `dev/console` node to the cpio.

### 3. Logs without a serial console
* The stock cmdline has `loglevel=1`, so nothing reaches `console-ramoops`.
* pstore only survives a warm reset. Most failures on this device end in a power cut, so init also
  persists its stage list and `dmesg` into unused space inside **boot_b at 48 MiB (8 MiB)**; it is read
  back from Android.
* A USB CDC-ACM function (`acm.GS0`) next to ECM gives a login console on the host
  (`/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS) that works even when networking does not.

## Hardware bring-up with the vendor modules

### 4. USB gadget dependency chain
The UDC only appears when the whole chain probes, in this order:
`extcon-usb-gpio` (the PHY node references `extcon-gpio`) → PHYs → `sc27xx_adc` → `sprd_battery_info`
→ `sprd-charger-manager` → `sc27xx_fuel_gauge` → `bq2560x-charger` (provides the `otg-vbus` regulator used as
`vbus-supply` by DWC3 and MUSB) → `dwc3-sprd` / `musb_sprd`.
* **`sc27xx_adc` must be loaded before the fuel gauge.** The vendor `sc27xx-fgu` driver returns a hard error
  (not `-EPROBE_DEFER`) when its IIO channel is missing and is never probed again.
* The exact working order of the 86 modules is in `boot/module-order.txt`.

### 5. The ~290 s power cut (PM co-processor watchdog)
* Symptom: Linux runs normally, then the device loses power about 290 s after boot. LK shows
  `charge first poweron reset`, not a watchdog reset.
* Cause: the PM co-processor (CM4, `pm_sys`) runs its own watchdog. `sprd_pmic_wdt` disarms it by sending
  `watchdog rstoff` over an SIPC sbuf channel, but that channel only becomes ready after Android's
  `modem_control` reloads `pm_sys` (and the modem) through Trusty (`kernelbootcp` TA).
* Fix: run Android's own `/vendor/bin/modem_control` in a chroot with Android's bionic linker and
  libraries. Requirements that were each discovered by failure:
  1. Copy `/dev/__properties__` from a running Android so property reads work.
  2. Create `/dev/block/by-name` links and apply Android's node ownership (`ueventd.rc` plus `chown`/`chmod`
     from vendor `init*.rc`), because `modem_control` drops to uid `system` (1000).
  3. Bind-mount a copy of `/proc/cmdline` with `androidboot.slot_suffix=_a` so it loads the `_a` modem images
     (LK passes `_b` when booting the trial slot).
  4. **Exec the binary directly.** `sprd_modem_loader` rejects every ioctl/write unless `current->comm` is
     exactly `modem_control` (`drivers/unisoc_platform/modem_loader`); running it as
     `linker64 /vendor/bin/modem_control` makes the task name `linker64`.
  5. Provide a sink for liblog (`tools/logdw`, listens on `/dev/socket/logdw`), otherwise the daemon's logs vanish.
* Result: `kbc_verify_all_avb2() ret = 0`, `SEC_KBC_START_CP() ret = 0`,
  `sprd-pmic-wdt: sbuf ready for pmic wdt init!`, `Modem Alive`, and no more power cut.

### 6. Load average of about 12 is not CPU usage
Vendor kernel threads (`sprd-rotation/N`, `sipa-*`, `slog`) wait in `D` state; Linux counts them in the load
average. `top` shows about 98 % idle.

## Custom kernel

### 7. Matching source
* The ZTE U30 Air kernel (`github.com/Enceka/android_kernel_zte_ums9620_mifi_u30air`, "downloaded from ZTE
  opensource") is exactly 5.4.254, covers 137 of the 150 F50 vendor modules and all but one derived config
  symbol of the F50 stock config.
* Missing from that tree: camera/display/GPU/touch modules (not used on this device) and the Wi-Fi driver
  `sprd_wlan_combo`, which is taken from the realme C51/C53 AndroidT kernel_modules drop.
* An older Unisoc 5.4.147 tree lacks the whole qogirn6pro USB stack and is not usable.

### 8. Build notes
* Full LTO needs more than 8 GiB in the linker step; ThinLTO keeps CFI and links fine.
* Stock config + `kernel/mu300-linux.fragment` adds devtmpfs, fhandle, autofs, SysV IPC, namespaces, nftables,
  btrfs/xfs/squashfs, NFS/CIFS, USB serial/modem/audio host drivers, crypto user API, CDC-ACM gadget, and removes
  `STATIC_USERMODEHELPER` and forced module signatures.
* All vendor modules must be rebuilt from the same tree (symbol CRCs change).

## Root filesystem on free eMMC space

### 9. Unused space after userdata
* `userdata` is 20 GiB and ends at sector 54218752; the GPT's last usable LBA is 122155007 and the backup GPT
  is at the very end. About **32.4 GiB between them belongs to no partition** and read back as zeros.
* The rootfs is an ext4 filesystem (`mu300root`) at byte offset `27762098176` (sector 54222848), 32.39 GiB,
  accessed through a loop device with an offset. **The GPT, userdata and all Android partitions are unchanged.**
* `userdata` uses metadata encryption (`dm-default-key`, `inlinecrypt`), so it cannot be shrunk or shared.

### 10. Mounting gotchas
* busybox `mount -o loop,offset=` only creates a loop for regular files; for a block device the options go to
  ext4 and fail with `EINVAL`. Use `losetup -o` and verify `/sys/block/loopN/loop/offset`.
* Android's `losetup -f` can return a loop index whose node does not exist yet; allocate, wait for the node and
  refuse to attach the same offset twice (two loops mounting one ext4 corrupted it once).
* Toybox `od` on 64 MiB is extremely slow; never interrupt a safety check, an interrupted pipeline "passed" once.

## Ubuntu 26.04 LTS on kernel 5.4

### 11. systemd 259 works on 5.4
5.4 is systemd's minimum baseline; the system boots to `running` with the `old-kernel` taint.

### 12. USB Ethernet must be up before the host activates ECM
* Symptom: macOS shows the "MU300 Linux USB Ethernet" interface as `inactive` forever, no DHCP, although on the
  device `usb0` is UP with carrier.
* Cause: `usb0` was only brought up by a systemd unit a few seconds after the UDC was bound. f_ecm reports the link
  in its first CONNECT notification and macOS' `AppleUserECM` does not pick up a later "connected" notification.
* Fix: `ifconfig usb0 up` immediately after binding the UDC in the initramfs.

### 13. Userland needing newer syscalls
* Ubuntu 26.04's GNU `tar` fails with `Function not implemented` when extracting (it relies on `openat2`,
  Linux 5.6). Use busybox `tar` on the device or extract from another system.
* `ssh.service` is socket-activated on 26.04; enable `ssh.socket`, not only `ssh.service`.
* Extracting an archive that contains a `lib/` directory over Ubuntu replaces the `/lib -> usr/lib` symlink with a
  directory (systemd then disappears). Always ship files under `usr/lib/...`.
* `docker export` leaves `/etc/hostname` empty.

## Wi-Fi (SC2355 / Marlin3)

### 14. Bring-up
* Modules: `pcie-sprd-misc`, `pcie-sprd`, `wcn_bsp`, `sprd_wlan_combo`.
* Firmware and board config come from Android's `/odm/firmware`: `wcnmodem.bin`, `gnssmodem.bin`,
  `wifi_board_config.ini`, `wifi_board_config_ab.ini`. Place them in `/usr/lib/firmware`.
* The realme `wlan_combo` driver falls back to `wifi_board_config_hulk.ini` for unknown projects; the firmware then
  asserts with `CMD_DOWNLOAD_INI / LOAD_INI_DATA_FAILED` and the chip stays in "card dump" state, so `wlan0` cannot
  be brought up (`RTNETLINK answers: No such device`). `kernel/patches/wlan_combo-default-board-config.patch` fixes it.
* `rmmod wcn_bsp` crashes the kernel; reboot instead of reloading the Wi-Fi stack.
* The driver logs `API version not match` for a few command IDs (the realme driver is slightly older than the ZTE
  firmware) and a `WARNING` in `sc2355_free_cmd_buf` (spin_unlock_bh in IRQ context).
* Verified after the fix: the driver parses `wifi_board_config.ini`, `wlan0` comes up, `iw dev wlan0 scan` lists
  nearby networks and `hostapd` (nl80211, WPA2) reaches `AP-ENABLED`. The MAC address is randomized on each load.
* A crash right after installing a module can leave a 0-byte `.ko` on ext4; run `sync` after installing files.

## Mobile data without Android RIL

### 15. Radio, registration and the data bearer
* AT channels: `/dev/stty_nr0` carries unsolicited results (URCs); `/dev/stty_nr1` is a clean command channel.
* After `modem_control` boots the modem the radio is off (`+CFUN: 0`). Android's RIL (`libimpl-ril.so`) uses the Unisoc
  commands `AT+SFUN=2` (SIM on) and `AT+SFUN=4` (protocol stack on); afterwards `+CFUN: 1` and the modem registers
  (`+CEREG: 2,1,...,13` = E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity, i.e. 5G NSA).
* The network activates the default EPS bearer (CID 1, IPv4v6) by itself. `AT+CGCONTRDP=1` returns the address as
  `a.b.c.d.m.m.m.m` plus DNS servers. `AT+CGDATA="M-ETHER",1` answers `CONNECT` and binds the bearer to
  `sipa_eth0` (`sipa_eth<cid-1>`, raw IP, `NOARP`). Assign the address as /32 and route `default dev sipa_eth0`.
* Measured on a Turkcell 5G NSA SIM: about 9.3 MB/s download and 1.3 MB/s upload. `rootfs/.../mobile-data` implements
  up/down/status/sim-reset and NAT (`nftables masquerade` + MSS clamping) so USB/Wi-Fi clients can share the link.
* AT responses can arrive after a short read timeout and then show up as answers to the next command. Drain the channel
  before sending and read until the final result code (`OK`, `ERROR`, `+CME ERROR`, `CONNECT`).
* Hot-swapping the SIM leaves it busy (`+CME ERROR: 14`) and registration stays at emergency-only (`+CEREG: 2,8`);
  reboot after changing the SIM.
* A SIM without an active data plan still registers and gets an address; TCP handshakes may even succeed, but no data
  flows. Check the plan before debugging the data path.

### 16. Rootfs details found while testing data
* `docker export` leaves an empty `/etc/resolv.conf`: `resolvectl query` works but glibc programs cannot resolve names.
  Link it to `../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`.
* busybox/toybox tar drop xattrs, so `ping` loses `cap_net_raw`; `mu300-fixups.service` restores it.
* Android's uid `system` (1000) is also Ubuntu's first user, so modem device nodes show up as owned by `ubuntu`.
